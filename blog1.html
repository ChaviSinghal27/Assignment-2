            <p>obstacles are there in everyone’s life it can be in any form. No problem is predefined small or big the person who is suffering from the problem only he/she can tell if the problem for him/her is big or small. But how you solve is what that matters.</p> 

                <P>I believe problems have purpose in our lives I mean because there are problems we are able to appreciate the small happy moments and because there are problems we are more grateful towards life and are able to see how privelleged we are.</P>
                
                <P>So how could we solve our problems the better way. A very important and the very first step towards solving a problem is “don’t react to the problem but act towards it”. I believe that half of your problem get solved if you perceive that problem in a correct manner. So for example you can always think that why only I get into trouble or why my luck is so bad. Or rather thinking about all of these things you can calm yourself and think to yourself ok now this is the situation what is the best I can do in this given situation. Or you can think I am strong and I can handle the problem I don’t know how to but I will figure it out. All I want to say is problem will always be there in your life so either you can cry about it or you can handle them in a better way. What do I mean by this is whenever there is a problem your reflex to the problem should be first that whatever has to happen has happened, now what is the best thing or what is the appropriate thing to do right now And if the problem is very huge and you are not able to digest it you should always reach out to that one person you think will give you the strength to handle it.</P>
                    <p>Once you have done what could be done at that very moment then give yourself some time and then when you think you are fine then slowly slowly take one step at a time and try to untangle the problem and one very important thing in this process is sometimes things will take time to recover at that time you need to trust the process and believe in yourself that with time things will get okay and it surely will, you just need to be a little patient about it.</p>
                
                <P>Every problem teaches you something it can be anything like patience, believing in yourself, etc. so even after you solve your problem always go back and introspect yourself that did you approach the problem the correct way, what did you learn from this experience and obviously appreciate yourself that you came a step ahead you become stronger than you were before. As there is a quote: “A problem can either give you a wound or can make you wiser”.</P>
